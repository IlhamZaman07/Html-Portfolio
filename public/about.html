<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Ilham Zaman, a passionate web developer who loves building clean, responsive, and interactive websites. I enjoy turning creative ideas into functional web experiences using modern technologies</p>
<p>I’m currently learning full-stack development, focusing on both front-end design and back-end logic to create complete web solutions. My goal is to grow as a developer, work on real-world projects, and eventually launch my own tech startup</p>
